# OPCUA_sim
Simulator for an industrial saw that uses the OPC UA protocol for communication between the backend and an external Edge device. This project aims to create a realistic simulation for testing, performance analysis, and training.

## **To-Do List:**

### **Backend**
- Simulate realistic alarms with tangible impacts on the simulation.

### **Additional Features**
- **Scrap piece counting**: Implement a system to track and record the number of scrap pieces during the cutting process.  
- **OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) calculation**: Provide an indicator of the machine's overall performance based on availability, performance, and quality.  
- **Angled cutting capability**: Enable material cutting at predefined angles (0°, 45°, 60°).  
- **Material section type selection**: Add options to choose the material's section type (e.g., round, square, rectangular).  
- **Blade break-in**: Simulate the blade break-in process to ensure optimal performance and increased durability.  
- **Customization of cutting parameters**: Allow users to select cutting speed and feed rate to optimize the process based on the material and specific requirements.
